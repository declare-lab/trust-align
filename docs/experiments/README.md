# Benchmarking your RAG setup with Trust Eval

In this tutorial, we will show you how to evaluate your RAG pipeline using our benchmark datasets (ASQA, ELI5 and QAMPARI) and Trust Eval metrics.

## Set up

Download `eval_data` from [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/declare-lab/Trust-Score/tree/main/Trust-Score) and place it at the same level as the prompt folder. If you would like to use the default path configurations, please do not rename the folders. If you rename your folders, you will need to specify your own path.

```text
quickstart/
â”œâ”€â”€ eval_data/
â”œâ”€â”€ prompts/
```

## Quick look at the data

In this tutorial, we are working with **ASQA** where the questions are of the type long form factoid QA. Each sample has 3 fields: `question`, `answers`, `docs`. Below is one example of the dataset:

```javascript
[ ...
    {   // The question asked.
        "question": "Who has the highest goals in world football?",

        // A list containing all correct (short) answers to the question, represented as arrays where each element contains variations of the answer. 
        "answers": [
            ["Daei", "Ali Daei"],                // Variations for Ali Daei
            ["Bican", "Josef Bican"],            // Variations for Josef Bican
            ["Sinclair", "Christine Sinclair"]   // Variations for Christine Sinclair
        ],

        // A list of 100 dictionaries where each dictionary contains one document.
        "docs": [
            {   
                // The title of the document being referenced.
                "title": "Argentina\u2013Brazil football rivalry",

                // A snippet of text from the document.
                "text": "\"Football Player of the Century\", ...",

                // A binary list where each element indicates if the respective answer was found in the document (1 for found, 0 for not found).
                "answers_found": [0,0,0],

                // A recall score calculated as the percentage of correct answers that the document entails.
                "rec_score": 0.0
            },
        ]
    },
...
]
    
```

Please refer to [datasets](../concepts/datasets.md) page for examples of how ELI5 or QAMPARI samples.

## Configuring yaml files

For generator related configurations, there are three field that are mandatory: `data_type`, `model` and `max_length`. `data_type` determines which benchmark dataset to evaluate on. `model` determines which model to evaluate and `max_length` is the maximum context length of the model. We will be using `Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct` in this tutorial but you can replace it with the path to your model checkpoints to evaluate your model.

```yaml
data_type: "asqa"
model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct
max_length: 8192
```

For evaluation related configurations, only `data_type` is mandatory.

```yaml
data_type: "asqa"
```

Your directory should now look like this:

```text
quickstart/
â”œâ”€â”€ eval_data/
â”œâ”€â”€ prompts/
â”œâ”€â”€ generator_config.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ eval_config.yaml
```

## Running evals

Now define your main script:

```python
from trust_eval.config import EvaluationConfig, ResponseGeneratorConfig
from trust_eval.evaluator import Evaluator
from trust_eval.logging_config import logger
from trust_eval.response_generator import ResponseGenerator

# Generate responses
generator_config = ResponseGeneratorConfig.from_yaml(yaml_path="generator_config.yaml")
logger.info(generator_config)
generator = ResponseGenerator(generator_config)
generator.generate_responses()
generator.save_responses()

# Evaluate responses
evaluation_config = EvaluationConfig.from_yaml(yaml_path="eval_config.yaml")
logger.info(evaluation_config)
evaluator = Evaluator(evaluation_config)
evaluator.compute_metrics()
evaluator.save_results()
```

Your directory should look like this:

```text
quickstart/
â”œâ”€â”€ eval_data/
â”œâ”€â”€ prompts/
â”œâ”€â”€ example_usage.py
â”œâ”€â”€ generator_config.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ eval_config.yaml
```

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python example_usage.py 
```

> Note: Define the GPUs you wish to run on in `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`. For reference, we are able to run up to 7b models on two A40s.

## The end

Congratulations! You have reached the end of the tutorial and you are now ready to benchmark your own RAG application! ðŸ¥³

If you are interested in running the evaluations with custom data instead of benchmark data, please refer to the guide in [quickstart](../quickstart).
